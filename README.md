Problem statement : A WHO (world health organization) estimated 12millions Death Recoreds. One of them half off the death result is found in US.The research scholars point out the most Realavent Risk factor of heartattack as a Data Science Engineer Predict the overall Risk Using Machine Learning algorithms called as Logistic Regression 

   TASK:
   1. Import the librares which required for prediction 

   2. Import the data set 

   3. User appropriate arguments of sklearn library to train , test and split the data set

   4. Fitt ur values with arrange function using future scalling .

   5. Check ur model accuracy and precission using confusion matrix.
